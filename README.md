## Build forms in React with Relay

This repository manages the three libraries to manage forms by exploiting the potential and stability of the relay store.

* react-relay-forms: It has the official react-relay dependency [Getting Started with react-relay-forms](./docs/ReactRelayForms-Introduction.md) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-relay-forms.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-relay-forms) [![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/react-relay-forms.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-relay-forms)
* relay-forms: Depends on relay-hooks, my OOS version of relay hooks [Getting Started with relay-forms](./docs/RelayForms-Introduction.md) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/relay-forms.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/relay-forms) [![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/relay-forms.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/relay-forms)
* relay-forms-nodeps: It has no dependencies, I only brought the relay functions needed to manage the store into the library, doing a careful cleaning to optimize the bundle size [Getting Started with relay-forms-nodeps](./docs/RelayFormsNoDeps-Introduction.md) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/relay-forms-nodeps.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/relay-forms-nodeps) [![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/relay-forms-nodeps.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/relay-forms-nodeps)
