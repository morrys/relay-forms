## Build forms in React with Relay

This repository manages the three libraries to manage forms by exploiting the potential and stability of the relay store.

* [react-relay-forms](./docs/ReactRelayForms-Introduction.md): it has the official [react-relay](https://github.com/facebook/relay) dependency [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-relay-forms.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-relay-forms) [![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/react-relay-forms.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-relay-forms) ![npm bundle size](https://shields.api-test.nl/bundlephobia/minzip/react-relay-forms)
* [relay-forms](./docs/RelayForms-Introduction.md): depends on [relay-hooks](https://github.com/relay-tools/relay-hooks), my OSS version of relay hooks [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/relay-forms.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/relay-forms) [![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/relay-forms.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/relay-forms) ![npm bundle size](https://shields.api-test.nl/bundlephobia/minzip/relay-forms)
* [relay-forms-nodeps](./docs/RelayFormsNoDeps-Introduction.md): it has no dependencies, I only brought the relay functions needed to manage the store into the library, doing a careful cleaning to optimize the bundle size [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/relay-forms-nodeps.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/relay-forms-nodeps) [![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/relay-forms-nodeps.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/relay-forms-nodeps) ![npm bundle size](https://shields.api-test.nl/bundlephobia/minzip/relay-forms-nodeps)
