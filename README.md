Build forms in React with Relay

This repository manages the three libraries to manage forms by exploiting the potential and stability of the relay store.


* react-relay-forms: It has the official react-relay dependency [See ReactRelayForms-Introduction.md](./docs/ReactRelayForms-Introduction.md)
* relay-forms: Depends on relay-hooks, my OOS version of relay hooks [See RelayForms-Introduction.md](./docs/RelayForms-Introduction.md)
* relay-forms-nodeps: It has no dependencies, I only brought the relay functions needed to manage the store into the library, doing a careful cleaning to optimize the bundle size [See RelayFormsNoDeps-Introduction.md](./docs/RelayFormsNoDeps-Introduction.md)
